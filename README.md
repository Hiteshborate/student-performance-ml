# Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a beginner-friendly machine learning application that predicts whether a student will **PASS or FAIL** based on study habits and academic factors.

The goal of this project is to understand the **complete machine learning workflow**, including data analysis, model training, evaluation, and prediction on new data.

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:

- study_hours – Daily study hours
- attendance – Attendance percentage
- previous_score – Previous exam score
- sleep_hours – Daily sleep hours
- internet_access – Internet availability (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

**Target variable:**
- result – Pass (1) or Fail (0)

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Workflow
1. Data loading and understanding  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Data preprocessing and encoding  
4. Train–test split  
5. Model training using Logistic Regression  
6. Model evaluation (accuracy & confusion matrix)  
7. Prediction on new unseen data  

---

## 🤖 Model Used
- **Logistic Regression** (Classification)

---

## ✅ Results
- The model successfully predicts student performance.
- Predictions were validated using unseen test data and new CSV input.

---

## 🧪 Example Prediction
Input:
- study_hours = 5  
- attendance = 80  
- previous_score = 60  
- sleep_hours = 7  
- internet_access = 1  

Output:
- **PASS**
